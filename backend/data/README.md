# Data Directory

This directory is for test video files used by the vehicle detection system.

## Required Video Files

Place your test video files here:
- `car.mp4` - Gate camera footage
- `gate2.mp4` - Plant area camera footage

Or use your own video files and update the paths in `main.py` accordingly.

## Note

Video files are excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`).
